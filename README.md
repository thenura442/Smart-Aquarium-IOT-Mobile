# Smart Aquarium IOT Mobile App

### IoT-based Monitoring System:

This project entails the development of a sophisticated monitoring system for fish tanks leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system is designed to provide comprehensive insights into the fish tank environment, ensuring optimal conditions for aquatic life. The system operates autonomously, continuously collecting data from the sensors placed within the fish tank. This data is then processed and analyzed to provide valuable insights into the fish tank environment, without requiring constant human intervention.

### Integrated Mobile Application:

A key component of the system is a user-friendly mobile application that allows users to interact with the monitoring system seamlessly. Through the mobile app, users can access real-time data from the fish tank sensors, receive notifications, and make necessary adjustments remotely.
